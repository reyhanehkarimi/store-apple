            <h3>What is Mac</h3>
            <p>The  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)">Mac</a>, short for Macintosh (its official name until 1999),<br>
                is a family of personal computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc.<br>
                The product lineup includes the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops,<br>
                and the iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro desktops.<br>
                Macs are sold with the macOS operating system.<br>

            <h4>What is a MacBook</h4>
            <p>The MacBook is a brand of Macintosh laptop computers designed by Apple.<br> 
                These laptop computers make use of the macOS operating system since 2006.<br> 
                In 2005, the Mac switched to Intel CPUs instead of PowerPC processors,<br>
                and the PowerBook and iBook names were replaced by MacBook.<br>

                <p>The MacBook Air is Apple's least expensive notebook computer.<br>
                    While the 1st generation was released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the 2006 â€“ 2012 MacBook,<br>
                    lowered prices on subsequent iterations and the discontinuation of that MacBook has made it serve as the entry-level Mac portable.</p>
